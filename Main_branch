# This file is your main branch.

In this file you would hypothetically have the source code that would comprise the main line of development for your repository. 

Some examples of projects that you could develop/have been developed in the main branch of a repository are software applications, open source projects (operating systems, programming languages, libraries), websites and blogs, games, 
educational resources, etc. 

You will be making a branch off of this file, and will be making edits to this file in your branch and then will merge your branch back to the main branch.
